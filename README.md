Linear base is a standard library for developing applications with linear
types. It is named `linear-base` to be an analog to the original [`base`]
package that ships with GHC.

The purpose of `linear-base` is to provide the minimal facilities you need to
write _practical_ Linear Haskell code, i.e., Haskell code that uses the
`-XLinearHaskell` language extension.

## Motivation

_Why do you need `linear-base` to write linear projects?_

1. If you are writing a linear function, you cannot use the standard
  non-linear data types, functions and classes in `base`. Even simple uses of
  `base` facilities break down. For instance, if `n` is a linearly bound `Int`,
  the RHS of an definition cannot write `n + 1` --- this will not type check. We need
  linear variants of `Num`, `Functor`s, `Monad`s, `($)`, etc.

2. There are several primitive data structures, functions and classes
  that can only be safely released with `-XLinearHaskell`.  For example, the
  API for file IO released by `linear-base` is safe unlike the current API
  which allows, say, reading from a closed file handle.  _Some of these are new
  and exciting because they are not in `base`, e.g., `linear-base` releases a
  safe API for mutable arrays allowing values to be updated in place!_

## Getting Started

Since -XLinearTypes are not part of a GHC release, we need to use nix to get a
version of GHC with support for linear types.

1. In your stack project, add our [`shell-stack.nix`] and [`nixpkgs.nix`] files.
2. Edit your `stack.yaml` to have the following fields.  _Use an appropriate
   commit in the `extra-deps`._

```yaml
resolver: lts-16.2
compiler: ghc-8.11
allow-newer: true
system-ghc: true

nix:
  enable: true
  shell-file: shell-stack.nix
  path: ["nixpkgs=./nixpkgs.nix"]

extra-deps:
  - git: https://github.com/facundominguez/quickcheck.git
    commit: a498e7b41131cf7955b9e154ab26d37d1be10304
  - git: https://github.com/facundominguez/lifted-async.git
    commit: 898eb485b21cc321058345998eedd8c409c326fd
  - git: https://github.com/tweag/linear-base.git
    commit: 705522f0bad3f1083bb3447b9f476f6f84d21410
```

4. Add `linear-base` to your cabal file's `build-depends:` for the appropriate
   library or executable.

5. You're done! You can add `{-# LANGUAGE LinearTypes #-}` to the top of your
   modules and build with `stack build` and test with `stack test` and so on.
   To learn more about stack-nix integration, see
   [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/nix_integration/).

## User Guide

If you already know what `-XLinearHaskell` does and what the linear arrow
`a #-> b` means, then read the [User Guide] and the [`/examples`] to know how to
use `linear-base`.

## Learning about `-XLinearHaskell`

If you're a Haskeller who hasn't written any Linear Haskell code, don't fear!
There are plenty of excellent resources and examples to help you.
